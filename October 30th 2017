Text Analysis - synonimous to many with what digital humanities is all about
All comes down to counting and counting things at scale 
Mining the dispatch
Problem of indexing - topic modelling 
Feed a boatload of text in and out comes the topics that are in your data
Interesting patterns that you can explain with your historical sensibility
Once one person figures out how to do something digital it becomes much easier because more people do it
Topic modelling has started to fall out of fashion because very few use topic modelling projects appropriately
Be wary of letting the text drive the analysis
A distribution over distributions - machine is looking at each word in relation to every other word in the document and in the corpus 
There are buckets of themed words and they can be pulled out and arranged then from the created text the computer can decompose and change it to buckets
You need to choose how many buckets you are looking for. This is only a problem when you believe that the computer should give you the answer
You can get the computer to optimize the data but essentially its up to you to interplay with the machine and look at how the corpus looks with a certain amount of topics
Not about getting an answer but rather getting a new view of the world

Mindset that enables computational analysis was always there before it was possible
The more a computer runs the more sense a topic model will make
Topic modelling is an unsupervised approached and you give it a certain number of topics and then run over and over with a different number of question
Its all about probability so the edges will be slightly different
