# October 16 2017 - Notes

### Initial Notes:
-Infrastructure questions that we will see come up over and over again
-"Riding the horseless carriage to the digital revolution" 
-There is a continuous attempt to recreate the past 
-*Reminder:* Text Analysis Seminar on October 30th

### Code
-Ridged categories meet up with the more malleable terms that break down definitions

#### What is code?
-A hierarchy and taxonomy in which framework, language, and instructions work to understand a system
-Fundamentally, software is a thing with a physical existence in the world, ultimately there are electrical pulses channeling down through the material
-The tools change the way that you think
-There is a distiction that must be made between the act of coding and code itself 
-Creative and expressive potential that is embodied in code 
-"I don't know what art is but I know it when I see it"
-There has been a cultural shift in relation to the do it yourself ideology in which now the digital interface is more secretive
-Coding is a hierarchic hieratic in which there is a relationship to power and money and who gets to speak
-*Article* "How Facebook Ruined America's Demoncracy*
-Netlogo - a simulator site 
-If you use a computer for something you are a coder

-**Working definition:** Digital coding is the process of using binary digits to represent letters, characters and other symbols in a digital format. 

#### Most Provocative or Troubling Concept within the Reading:
 -Planned obsolecence as a money making device 
 -The power embedded within code as a creator of reality as it is linked to capitalistic ventures
 -Things that never end; the cult of ever-increasing improvement
 -The myth of the Digital Native vs. the Digital Immigrant - people take this as an excuse to never teach about digital literacy and programming
 -Technology does not have to be non-humanistic; an older era in computing stressed people, while the later article sstressed finalcials in which the goal is to sell
 -Rehashing old concept in a new way - coders as labourers 
 -Code is literally everywhere but a large amount of people are unaware of how things work
 -Code is a magic mirror the reflects ourselves to ourselves which has the possibility to have unintended consequences and then whose responsibility is it to fix things
 -Who gets left out of our truth telling narratives?
 -*What would a feminist coding language look like? What would a marxist code look like?*
 
 #### What do Undergraduate Students Need to Know about Code and How are we going to Work together to Achieve this?
 
 ####Discussion:
 -Aim for about an hour of discussion 
 -Look up techniques for small group discussion leading 
 -Google Books Ngram viewer
