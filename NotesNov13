##Visualization
With visualization you often cannot just have the graphic but you it is also signifigant to add the text to explain the graphic

Etymology:
From Latin videre meaning to see and visus meaning sight, then late latin visualis moved to the late Middle English word visual
"A mapping between discrete data and a visual representation" - Lev Manovich 

Types of Visualization:
-Information visualization: non-spatial, numeric, and non-numeric data to create graphs and charts
-Scientific visualization: to graphically illustrate scientific data, which can often only be percieved by somebody with a background in the field
-Geovisualization: layers of data on a map, deals mostly with mapping and urban visualizations 

Types of Data:
-Spatial: position, size, shape, and linear curves
-Non-Spatial: numbers, characters, logical type
-Numeric: numbers
-Non-numeric: network simulations, text

Information visualization is good to show data but it does not give all the information and as such they often cannot live without text support
